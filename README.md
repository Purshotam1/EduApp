# EduApp

This is a prototype which we will be using for rural education so that the students there can easily understand the concepts and relate it with their day to day life.

We are giving them the most relatable examples so that they can relate the theoritical concepts with their day to day life experiences. Also we have depicted the concepts in real world through the concept of Augmented Reality.

An app made using React-Native for rural education. AR support is provided in this app for eg. like pasting a skull animation on the face using face detection or like showing the digestive system pasted on the human body. Content and examples have been shown on every topic and feedback is recorded on examples. This feedback is used in the recommender system to suggest new examples.
